# MoogPy
Python-Fortran hybrid version of MOOG spectral synthesis code


# Installation
1) fork the repository
2) ensure that MoogPy/MoogTools/ is in your PYTHONPATH, or otherwise visible from your python session
3) enter the MoogPy/MoogSource/ directory, run the recompile.sh script.  This will compile the FORTRAN part of Moog, wrap it in python, and copy the MoogPy.so file to the MoogPy/MoogTools/ directory
4) Download the MoogPyData.tar.gz file from http://www.mpia.de/~deen/Software/MoogPy/MoogPy.html (Github's ~ doesn't seem to translate right now, so you may have to copy and paste the URL into your browser bar), place it in the MoogPy/data/ directory, and unzip it.  It should create 3 directories (AbsorptionLines, Atmospheres, and ObservedSpectra) filled to the brim with useful data.
5) Start up python
6) run example.py
